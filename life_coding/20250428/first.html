        A key objective for the WHATWG was backwards compatibility to ensure good rendering of existing websites. 
        Another objective was that the specification be detailed enough that implementers such as browser developers can achieve complete interoperability without reverse-engineering. 
        With these objectives in mind, the dependence of HTML on SGML was eliminated for HTML 5 and the specification includes details on how browsers are to render pages and how parsers are to handle shortcuts such as missing end tags. 
        For example, the specification states that "A elementâ€™s end tag may be omitted if the element is immediately followed by another element, or if there is no more content in the parent element." 
        HTML parsers/validators will accept these omissions. The specification also incorporates two serializations, the backwards-compatible HTML serialization (documented in 8.
        The HTML syntax) and a stricter XML-based serialization (documented in 9. The XML syntax), sometimes referred to as XHTML5, and compatible with the earlier W3C Recommendations for XHTML.
        The XML-based serialization requires the use of a different Internet media type and has different rules for declarations at the beginning of the document.
